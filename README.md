# Image-based survey example

When working in my graduate thesis I needed to conduct an infinite survey of pair of images. Ok, it was not infinite, but I wanted it to be flexible so I could save the responses regardless of the number of questions the surveyee answered.

The result of this template is here > https://image-based-ex.herokuapp.com/welcome

## Libraries

* Framework: Flask
* Database server: PostgreSQL

My core training is in Transportartion Engineering, so I learnt from scratch to develope the app for my thesis. I hope this basic strutcture is usefull to someone else who need an image-based survey a little bit more customizable than online platformas as Google Forms, Qualtrics or Survey Monkey.
